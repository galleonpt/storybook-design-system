## Motivation

Working as a frontend developer showed me some cool tools to use to understand how te components should behave and one of them was **Storybook**.

To under stand how to use **Storybook** I decided to make a "design system"(with onle a button and some variation) to understand how this tool works and can help us, developers, to write our code daily.

## Results

To see the outcome of this project you can:

-   Clone the repo
-   Install dependencies
-   Run `npm run storybook`
